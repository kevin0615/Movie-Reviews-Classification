# Text classification project

For this project I use the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/. The dataset contains the text of 2000 movie reviews. 1000 are positive, 1000 are negative, and the text has been preprocessed as a tab-delimited file.

Based exclusively on the content of the movie reviews, I develop two classification models that can predict the class labels "Positive" or "Negative" of a review.
I start with a Na√Øve Bayes model and follow with a Linear Support Vector Classifier.
