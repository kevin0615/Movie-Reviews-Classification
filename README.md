# Text classification project

For this project I use the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/.

Based exclusively on the content of the movie reviews, I develop a classification model that can predict "Positive" or "Negative" class labels of a review.
